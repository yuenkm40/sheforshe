## Deployment of application 
This application is deployed using a Linode server.

### Node.js setup
Install Node.js with curl using the following commands. Note that at the time which the app was built the node version is 16.3.2 and npm version is 8.1.2.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Check to see if node was installed
node --version
npm --version
```

### Get the files on the server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuenkm40/sheforshe.git
```

### App setup and running the app
Download dependencies, create built file and run the application on the server.
```bash
cd app

# App will be served on port 5000
npm run prod
```

### PM2 Setup
PM2 is a production process manager from Node.js. It allows us to keep Node apps running without having to have terminal open with npm start, etc like we do for development.

First install PM2 globally with NPM
```bash
sudo npm install -g pm2
```
Run with PM2
```bash
pm2 start app/server.js
```

### Firewall setup
Setup a firewall so that people can not directly access any port except ports for ssh, http and https.

```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow ssh (Port 22)
sudo ufw allow http (Port 80)
sudo ufw allow https (Port 443)
```

### Nginx Setup
Nginx, stylized as NGIÐ˜X, is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.

Install nginx on server.
```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```
Configure a proxy for our MERN app by changing config file.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```
Find location area in file and replace with
```bash
location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;    # or which other port your app runs on
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
```
